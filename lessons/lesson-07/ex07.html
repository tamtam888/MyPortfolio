<h1>Yesterday - The Beatles</h1>

<p class="verse">
    <span class="first-line">Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away</span><br>
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay<br>
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
</p>

<p class="chorus">
    <span class="first-line">Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be</span><br>
    There's a shadow hanging over me<br>
    Oh, yesterday came suddenly
</p>
